Given the array arr[9]; What are the valid indices of the array?
0-8 are the valid indices


What happens when we access an invalid index of an array?
1) we get what's in memory at that spot
2) segmentation fault
3) program stops


What does arr[3][4] actually declare?
2d array 3 rows 4 columns - this is how we think of it
Actually it is an array containing arrays, in this case
    an array containing 3 arrays that have 4 items each.


Given the array arr[4][5]; How many slots exist in the 2D array?
20 spots, four rows (indices 0-3) of 5 columns (indices 0-4)


Given the array arr[10] = {1, 2, 3, 4}; what is in arr[4]?
Once we use an initialization list, all other elements are initialized.
Therefore, the value stored in arr[4] is 0


Can we do int arr2d[3][4] = {{1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3,5}, {1,2,3,6}}?
Yes, each row is initialized with its initialization list.


Can we do int arr2d[3][4] = {{1,2,3,4}, {1,2}, {1,2,3,6}}?
Yes, the second row's initialization list causes it to end with 
    two zeros.


Can we do int arr2d[3][4] = {{1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3,5}, {1,2,3,6}, {1,2}}?
No, there is no room for a fourth row.


What is missing from the following function header?
    
void print2DArray(int arr[][])
{
    // Code
}

1) second parameter for number of rows
    or a gobal constant can be used, but the parameter is preferred
2) the array is simply printing, so it should be constant
3) the second dimension must be specified, the number of columns as
    in: arr[][numCols]
