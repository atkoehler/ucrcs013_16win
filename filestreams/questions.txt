// Questions covered in lecture January 25, 2016

What library do we need to include to use file streams?
We use the fstream library, e.g. #include <fstream>
// previously we used iostream for input & output


What are string streams utilized for?
1) use on a large string and then break out into pieces
2) convert a string to int or int to string
3) read items from a string rather than input

// Convert integer for concatenation purposes
string s = "hello";
int i = 1;

// We cannot do this
s = s + i;

// We can convert the integer to string using string streams.
string newS;
ostringstream ss;
ss <<  i;
newS = ss.str();

// Now we can perform concatenation with two strings.
s = s + newS;
