# Recursion Examples
Recursion examples show how to break down problems into smaller subproblems, solve those subproblems, and finally combine the results to solve the initial proble.

As we cover recursion, this directory will be filled with in class examples and lecture code of recursive implementaitons and algorithms that were utilized to discuss and teach recursion.
